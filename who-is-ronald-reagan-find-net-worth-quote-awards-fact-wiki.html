As of early 2016, it was a reported $13 million, gained mostly from his long careers as an actor and politician.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=ronald-reagan-net-worth-13-million></span>Ronald Reagan Net Worth $13 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Born in Tampico, Illinois, Reagan was the youngest son of Nelle and John Reagan. Because of his father’s line of work as a traveling salesman, the family often moved but finally settled in Dixon. He attended Dixon High School where he became involved in various activities including football, basketball, journalism and school plays. Upon matriculation, Reagan pursued higher education in Eureka College in Illinois, majoring in economics and sociology. He worked during his university years to support himself and his family, until he graduated in 1932.</p><p>Upon graduation, Reagan worked in a radio station as the sports broadcaster for baseball games. After working in the radio industry, from Des Moines he travelled to California and attended a screen test at Warner Brothers to become an actor. In 1937, he was offered work with Warner Brothers for seven years. Reagan had a successful run as an actor, making over 50 films in the course of 20 years, making him a well-known actor and also helping his net worth. Some of his projects were “Love Is on the Air”, “The Killers”, “Brother Rat” and “Knute Rockne-All American” which people consider as his breakout movie.</p><p>When the war broke out in 1941, Reagan helped the Army by serving and making over 400 training films for fellow soldiers. After his stint in the military, he went back in the world of acting, but this time serving as the president of the Screen Actors Guild. He also worked with General Electric as its spokesperson after retiring as an actor.</p><p>In 1966, Reagan switched careers and ran for governor of California. He defeated opponent Edmund Brown, and won once again in the 1970 election. While being governor, he made bold moves in California, including raising the tax to solve the state’s budget deficit. His feat in the state of California led him to be nominated as the next president of the United States of America, alongside&nbsp;George H.W. Bush as his vice-president.</p><p>In 1980, Reagan won the presidential election, and served for two terms. During his term, he increased employment, cut back on taxes of low-income workers, reduced government expenditures and strengthened foreign relations with several countries. Reagan’s goal was to encourage the American people to believe in themselves again, which was successful, leaving with high approval ratings after his term as evidence that he had achieved his mission.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, Reagan married his first wife Jane Wyman in 1940 and together they have two children.

Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we’re as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions “yes”, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for.

But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.

His paternal grandfather, John Michael Reagan, was born in Peckham, co. Kent, England, to Irish parents, and his paternal grandmother, Jennie Cusick, was born in Dixon, Illinois, also to Irish parents. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Wilson, also an Illinois native, was of Scottish descent (partly by way of Canada), and his maternal grandmother, Mary Ann Elsey, was English, from Epsom, co. Surrey. His paternal great-grandfather, Michael Regan, emigrated to the US from Ballyporeen, Ireland, in the 1860s. Ballyporeen, a tiny rural farming town in County Tipperary, is located in the south-central part of the country and its inhabitants are frequently referred to as “Midlanders”. The Regans were one of three primary families, or “clans”, that populated St. Mary’s Parish in the village of Ballyporeen. The Ronald Reagan Visitors Centre was built down the street from St. Mary’s Church following his visit to his ancestral home in the mid-1980s. The spelling of the family name Regan was changed to Reagan after they arrived in the US.</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>As Captain in the U.S. Army, Reagan signed Major Clark Gable’s discharge papers in June 1944.</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>Emceed the first PATSY Awards show (1951) where Francis the Talking Mule was the very first winner. PATSY is an acronym for: Picture Animal Top Star of the Year.</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>The oldest man to serve as US President, he took office only 17 days before his 70th birthday and left office 17 days before his 78th. He was, in fact, older than four of the previous five presidents: John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter.</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>Continued to play golf with several friends including Bob Hope and Kevin Costner until 1996.</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>Although Reagan did not formally become a Republican until 1962, he never endorsed a Democrat after Helen Gahagan 1950 and voted for Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. He also actively campaigned for Richard Nixon in the 1960 presidential election.</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>Underwent hip replacement surgery in January 2001.</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>Reagan was the first “true blue” conservative to win the Republican nomination and be elected President since Calvin Coolidge in 1924.</td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>His closest friend in Hollywood was Robert Taylor.</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>Reagan and his wife Nancy were close friends of Rock Hudson, whose death in 1985 spurred the President to provide funds for AIDS research.</td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td>Spent World War II making Army training films for Hal Roach Studios.</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>His state funeral service took place on the 25th anniversary of the death of his close friend and ally John Wayne.</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>His famous nickname “The Great Communicator”, was not earned but was requested. Reagan asked for it during his farewell address in 1989.</td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>While as an actor he is thought of mostly as a Western/Action-Adventure star, his two best-remembered lines were from straight dramatic roles and delivered while he was flat on his back in bed, his character either dying or horribly crippled: “Win just one more for the Gipper!” in Knute Rockne All American (1940) and “Where’s the rest of me?” in Kings Row (1942).</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>After his presidency he and Nancy Reagan moved to 666 St. Cloud Road in Bel Air, California which Ronald lived in until his death. Nancy had the address changed from 666 to 668 due to the fact 666 is known as the devil’s number. The house is down the street from 805 St. Cloud Road, the house used in the TV show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990).</td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td>During the 1980 Presidential campaign, incumbent President Jimmy Carter publicly criticized Reagan for launching his campaign with a speech on states’ rights in Philadelphia, Mississippi, the site of the 1964 murder of three civil rights workers immortalized in the film Mississippi Burning (1988). Carter, a former governor of the Deep South state of Georgia who had run as a racial moderate in 1970, noted that the phrase “states’ rights” was a code word for segregation, as Southerners opposed to federally mandated integration of the races under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 claimed that such mandates “violated” state laws and local customs and were unconstitutional abrogations of the rights of their states to police themselves. Reagan, who had used his opposition to state equal housing laws to defeat Gov. Edmund G. Brown in the 1965 California governor’s race, disavowed any racist intent and the issue was ignored by most voters and pundits.</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, received an honorary British knighthood, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. This entitled him to the use of the post-nominal letters GCB, but did not entitle him to be known as “Sir Ronald Reagan”.

As the Constitution, in practical terms, forbids the president and vice president from being from the same state (a rule that binds the electoral college), Reagan was not considered for the vice presidency when Spiro Agnew resigned in 1973. Besides, though Reagan supported his fellow Californian Nixon for president, the two were never close. In 1976, he challenged incumbent Gerald Ford (the man whom Nixon appointed Vice President to replace Agnew) for the Republican nomination, won several primaries, but narrowly lost the nomination at the convention. Though Ford confided in people he was considering a run for the presidency in 1980 to forestall Reagan’s ascendancy, he never did and Reagan won the nomination and the presidency.</td></tr><tr><td>52</td><td>Rumored studio publicity claimed that he was scheduled to play Rick Blaine in Casablanca (1942); however, this was never the case.</td></tr><tr><td>53</td><td>He was the first former American president to die in the 21st century.</td></tr><tr><td>54</td><td>Pictured on a USA 37¢ commemorative postage stamp issued 9 February 2005. When the first-class letter rate was raised to 39¢ in January 2006, the US Postal Service received an unprecedented number of requests to reissue the stamp at the higher value. The 39¢ postage stamp was issued on 14 June 2006, using the same design as the earlier stamp.</td></tr><tr><td>55</td><td>Only United States President to have appeared in a shirt advertisement.</td></tr><tr><td>56</td><td>The former President was buried at his presidential library in Simi Valley, California.</td></tr><tr><td>57</td><td>The first President since Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve two full terms in office.</td></tr><tr><td>58</td><td>Pictured on a 60¢ memorial postage stamp issued by the Republic of the Marshall Islands 4 July, 2004, the first memorial to be issued in his honor.</td></tr><tr><td>59</td><td>A month after his death, items from his burial and week-long public viewing were selling fast on the online auction site eBay. The company has sold 780 pieces of Reagan funeral memorabilia since June 11, 2004, for a total of $66,000. The items range from programs (sold for up to $1,525 each) from the interment at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, CA, to gratitude cards given to mourners who visited his casket.</td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td>He played Chicago Cubs hurler Grover Cleveland Alexander in the film, The Winning Team (1952). He also served temporarily, as a broadcaster for WGN Radio, which broadcasts Cubs baseball games.</td></tr><tr><td>61</td><td>In the film, American Beauty (1999), the Fitts family (Chris Cooper, Allison Janney and Wes Bentley) can be seen watching one of Reagan’s wartime films, This Is the Army (1943).</td></tr><tr><td>62</td><td>He was offered, a role, in animation, of a guest appearance and an off screen voice, on The Simpsons (1989), but refused their offer.</td></tr><tr><td>63</td><td>He never actually broadcast Cubs games, he re-created them from telegraph reports while working for Des Moines radio station WHO in the 1930s. He demonstrated the technique of making it sound like he was actually at the games to Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray when he made a guest appearance during part of a Cubs telecast in the 1980s.</td></tr><tr><td>64</td><td>In 1978, after having served as governor of California but before running for President, Reagan came out against The Briggs Initiative, a ballot initiative introduced by a right-wing Republican state senator named John Briggs, which would have made it illegal for homosexuals to be employed as teachers in the California school system. Reagan strongly and vocally opposed the measure, saying that it infringed upon basic human rights and bordered on being unconstitutional. He is largely credited for turning public opinion against the measure and it was defeated in the election.</td></tr><tr><td>65</td><td>Had a photographic memory.</td></tr><tr><td>66</td><td>Became the first president to have a state funeral in Washington, D.C. since Lyndon Johnson in 1973.</td></tr><tr><td>67</td><td>Amidst the panic at the hospital after Reagan’s assassination attempt, a Secret Service agent was asked information for Reagan’s admission forms. The intern asked for Reagan’s last name. The agent, who was quite surprised at the question, responded “Reagan”. The intern then asked for Reagan’s first name. The agent, again surprised, responded “Ronald”. The intern didn’t look up, instead he unassumingly asked for Reagan’s address. The agent paused for a few moments in great surprise before saying “1600 Pennsylvania Avenue”. That got the intern’s attention.</td></tr><tr><td>68</td><td>At the time of his death he was the longest-living President of the United States, at age 93 years and 120 days. This record was broken by former President Gerald Ford on Monday, November 12, 2006. Their age difference, in days alone, was only 45 days. Reagan’s lifetime lasted 34,088 days, and Ford’s lasted 34,133 days.</td></tr><tr><td>69</td><td>Originally was a very liberal member of the Democratic Party, but eventually converted to the Republican Party in 1962, when he was fifty-one.
