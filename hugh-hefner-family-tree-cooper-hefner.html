She was named company president in 1982, and then chairman and chief executive officer in 1988. During her time at the company, she transformed the brand into a global giant, shutting down the original Playboy Clubs — a chain of nightclubs featuring waitresses dressed in Playboy bunny costumes — and helping launch Playboy TV and Playboy.com.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 1979 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a>, Hugh called his daughter "the brightest, most articulate 26-year old lady I have ever met" and addressed speculation that she became the figurehead of the company as a way of defusing feminist criticism of the magazine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Well, I have made the comment that [if] Christie hadn't existed, our promotion department might want to invent her," he said.

"I think they're finally realizing Playboy is not the enemy, it's a friend. They're realizing it's a men's magazine. It doesn't deal with all that it means to be woman. That's not its mission in life, any more than the women's magazines deal with the complexities of being man. In fact, part of the problem is that they don't even deal with the complexities of being a woman. I'm a lot more anxious to change what's going on in Cosmopolitan and Family Circle magazines than I am in Playboy, as far as roles for women are concerned."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Paul Zimmerman/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Asked if it would bother him to see Christie as a nude Playboy centerfold, Hugh said no.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's not likely to happen, but it wouldn't bother me," he said.

"Because society's expectations are so different for men and women, I think it is much more difficult to be my son than my daughter.

"It's not a boo-hoo sob story. But it's not the same as every other kid. … It's easy to tell who wants to be your friend for those reasons and who doesn't.
