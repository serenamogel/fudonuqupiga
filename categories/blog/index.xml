Dry
Aside from that, is Merlot wine sweet or dry in taste? Despite the fact that Merlot is a dry wine, it is sweeter than other red wines such as cabernet sauvignon and shiraz. In part because of Merlot‚Äôs gentler taste and lower tannin levels, winemakers often use it in blends to soften stronger red wines, particularly cabernet sauvignon, which has a harsher character.
